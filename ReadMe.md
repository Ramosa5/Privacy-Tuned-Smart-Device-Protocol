WHY:
According to IoT Analytics, there will be over 21 billion connected IoT devices globally by the end of 2025. Importantly, the protection of personal data within smart homes is increasingly at risk. And a home should be a secure and private environment, free from unauthorised external access.

HOW:
By assigning unique cryptographic keys to each IoT device and integrating them into a personal smart-home server, the system becomes significantly harder for external actors to compromise.

WHAT:
We propose a new connection protocol that securely interfaces each device with the smart-home system and prevents unauthorised access. 

VISION:
We ensure that your personal data is always protected, and you can feel safe within the home environment.
